1) we will use handlebars
2) it allows us to dynamically renders the documents as compare to static
3) it also create code that we can re use across multiple pages
4) previously we used res.send to send html contents and JSON object data
5) here with hbs we will use res.renders
6) render allow us to use the views. which we have set to node js to use the view engine
7) it will handle our handlebars templates

HOW TO INTEGRATE HANDLE BARS
* install npm package
* after const app = express()
    * type app.use('view engine', 'hbs') -> all the characters must be in small case

* then after it we can integrate handlebars functionality in our template using res.render and send our json object data to the template

* in order to change the name of the view folder we will set the alternate using app.
    app.set('views', viewDirectory) -> this will inform the express to see for template folder instead if view


EXAMPLE

app.get('', (req, res) => {
    res.render('index', {
        title: 'Weather App',
        name: 'Sheikh Afham',
    }) // we dont need to give full path, just name should be same. It will automatically goes to views folder

})

app.get('/about', (req, res) => {
    res.render('about', {
        title: 'About page of webserver',
        createdby: 'Sheikh Afham',
    }) // we dont need to give full path, just name should be same. It will automatically goes to views folder

})
